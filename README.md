# An-Intelligent-and-Optimized-AI-Framework-for-Mental-Health-Risk-Identification
Mental health has become a critical concern in today’s fast-paced world, with rising stress, anxiety, 
and depression affecting people across age groups. Early identification and timely support are 
essential to prevent the escalation of emotional distress, yet traditional mental health services 
often face barriers such as limited accessibility, delayed responses, and lack of personalized, real
time support. These gaps create a strong need for scalable, technology-assisted tools that can 
complement existing care and improve early awareness.  
With rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
intelligent systems can now analyze human language patterns to detect emotions and provide 
supportive feedback. This project, “An Intelligent and Optimized AI Framework for Mental Health 
Risk Identification,” proposes an AI-based framework that analyzes user interactions to detect 
emotional states and assess potential mental health risk levels. The system is designed to work 
through conversational inputs and aims to function as a supportive mental wellness companion 
rather than a replacement for clinical diagnosis. 
The core approach integrates transformer-based emotion classification—such as DistilBERT—to 
capture contextual meaning in user text and classify emotions using datasets like GoEmotions. 
Detected emotions are then mapped to structured risk categories (low, moderate, high) using a 
predefined risk strategy, enabling a more actionable interpretation of emotional signals. To ensure 
practical deployment, the framework emphasizes optimization techniques that enhance real-time 
inference, accuracy, and scalability.  
A key differentiator of the proposed system is its focus on empathetic response generation through 
positive reframing. Unlike conventional chatbots that may only provide basic emotional 
interaction, this framework aims to support users in managing negative emotions in a constructive 
way. Additionally, explainability tools such as SHAP and LIME are included to improve 
transparency and trust by highlighting factors influencing model predictions.  
Overall, this project targets a broad set of beneficiaries, including individuals experiencing 
emotional distress, mental health professionals seeking decision-support signals, educational 
institutions monitoring student well-being, and organizations promoting employee wellness. By 
combining emotion detection, risk assessment, explainable AI, and supportive reframing in a 
unified pipeline, the framework seeks to contribute toward more accessible, proactive, and 
awareness-oriented mental health support in the digital age.
